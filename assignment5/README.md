##Focus Event

A low-level event which indicates that a component has gained or lost the keyboard focus. This low-level event is generated by a component (such as a text field). The event is passed to every FocusListener or FocusAdapter object which registered to receive such events using the component's addFocusListener method. (FocusAdapter objects implement the FocusListener interface.) Each such listener object gets this FocusEvent when the event occurs. 


##Key Event

The Java KeyListener is notified whenever you change the state of key. It is notified against KeyEvent. The KeyListener interface is found in java.awt.event package.


##Mouse Event

Mouse events notify when the user uses the mouse (or similar input device) to interact with a component. Mouse events occur when the cursor enters or exits a component's onscreen area and when the user presses or releases one of the mouse buttons.
